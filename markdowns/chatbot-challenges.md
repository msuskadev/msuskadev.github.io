## Challenges of II Generation Chatbots

* Varieties in the way people type their message can make it hard to understand their intention
* The different ways in which humans talk can also be difficult for a chatbot to understand. For example, the user may use slang, misspell words and short form or acronyms.
* Human beings are random and user behavior is controlled by emotions and moods

Note:

ad 1.: Chatbots must be able to deal with both long and short sentences
ad 3: users may quickly change their minds. After initially asking for a suggestion, they might switch to wanting to give a command instead
